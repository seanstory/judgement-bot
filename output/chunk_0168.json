The model's final placing, after the Charge move, must be on an unoccupied hex with its Charge target within melee reach.\n\nNote: that the charging model still requires Line-of-Sight to its Charge target before the Charge move.\n\nWhen a Monster with Fly moves as part of the Hunter ability, it ignores intervening models and all terrain (including impassable) during movement. The Monster's final placing, after the Hunter ability move, must be on an unoccupied hex.",
