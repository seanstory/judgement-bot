  "text": "We have created a companion Quick-Start Guide for this rulebook to help you through your first game. We recommend starting with that before diving into all the nitty-gritties of the game. But if you're feeling ambitious, or have played before, then by all means, read on!\n\nThe old gods have perished. Only strong enough to delay the encroaching demon invasion, their deaths have wracked the outer planes of Athien. The once perfectly balanced tri-planes of Athien's existence are now at risk of total collapse.\n\nWithout the Effigy Network that the new gods have created in Mideon (the Between), nothing would stop the demons from consuming this universe. The fate of Athien is now in the hands of the six ascending gods, caught in a struggle to see who will establish control over the Effigy Network and harness its endless power.\n\nAs a Judgement player, you become one of the demigods, calling forth your Champions to fight and capture Effigies. You will need to manage multiple resources and exploit synergies between your Heroes to be victorious. All the while, you must combat your enemy's plans and the neutral Monsters that roam the battlefields of Mideon.",
