The following two stages are applied chronologically:\n\n- y Zero Health: Trigger any abilities or effects that rely on a Hero reaching zero health.\n\n- y Death/Die: Trigger any abilities or effects that rely on a Hero dying. Remove all Tokens (including Bound Souls and effects) from the model.\n\nIn both stages, if multiple abilities or effects trigger, the active player decides the order in which they are triggered.\n\nKilling Blow: The model that inflicts the last damage point, resulting in the death of an enemy model, is considered to have dealt the killing blow.\n\nMelee: A melee involves 2 or more models where at least 1 of them is either engaging, or being engaged by, the other model.\n\nOccupied/Unoccupied Hex: A hex is considered occupied when a Shrine, Effigy, impassable terrain feature, Soul, or other models (Heroes, Monsters and Summoned ) occupy that hex.
