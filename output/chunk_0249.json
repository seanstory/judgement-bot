Contesting the Shrine is dangerous while Gloom is on the board so you want to make sure your opponent is always closest to her during the Communion Phase!\n\nShrines: The Shrine awards D3 Fate to the Warband that controls it.\n\nMonsters: Gloom starts the game on the board and will respawn during the 2nd Communion Phase after she is killed. Randomise the Monster before players roll off for first turn/table sides.\n\nSouls: The first Soul spawns during the Communion Phase of the 2nd round and a new one will spawn each round after that in the same location.\n\nA Soul will not spawn if there are already 2 or more unbound Souls on the map.\n\nCoordinates : Impassable Terrain (2,3); Soul Pit (3,5); Wall (2,6) (3,7) (4,8); Random Monster Tier 1-3 (5,6); Smoke (6,6) (6,7) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) (8,6) (8,7); Treacherous Ground (8,6) (8,7); Shrine (9,6), Gloom (11,5); Forest (10,3) (11,2) (11,3) (12,2); Forest (12,6) (12,7) (12,8) (13,5); Centre hexes for Effigies (7,2) (7,10).",
