Ista spent her life guarding the villages on the edge of the Elvish territories. Marauders, beasts, and monsters were a constant danger - but Ista was the shield that protected the innocent. As a God, she is the epitome of everything honourable and righteous. Her followers are those who value truth, noble actions, and unity. She opposes corruption, deception, and deceit with all of her being, and insists all of her followers do the same.",
