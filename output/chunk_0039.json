This format is recommended for experienced players, or new players with a competitive spark.\n\nBoth players select 7 (5v5 mode) or 5 Heroes (3v3 mode), and line them up in front of themselves.\n\nPlayers roll a D6 initiative roll. The highest roll chooses one of the following, while the lowest roll takes the remaining option:\n\n- (A) Decide between vetoing 1st and taking the 1st turn, or vetoing 2nd and taking the 2nd turn.\n\n- (B) Choose table sides.\n\nAfter table sides have been chosen , follow this sequence with player 1 going first for each step.\n\n1. Players Veto (remove) a Hero from their opponent's pool.\n\n2. Players select their Warband from the remaining Heroes (for a total of 3 Heroes for Skirmish Mode and 5 Heroes for Battle Mode).\n\n3. In this format there is one Hero from each player's Hero pool that will not be selected, and must be removed from the game.",
