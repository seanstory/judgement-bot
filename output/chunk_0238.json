  "text": "Demons are an alien race to Athien, therefore the rules of the universe affect them differently than the inhabitants of Athien. This section details the different game mechanics for demons.\n\nNote: Lesser demons (generally Summoned models) do not benefit from these abilities.\n\nRumour has it that Lord Fazeal was once a noble who was consumed with his lust for power. During his time on Athien, he sought only to build his reputation and his fortune by whatever means necessary. Many of the deeds he accomplished have been lost to the annals of history, but his death is well known to any scholar that has any familiarity with the creation of undead and their relationship with Mideon.\n\nLord Fazeal was butchered by the members of his court who feared his growing interest in the dark arts. The rage and hatred that he felt towards the end of his legacy was legendary. It was so intense that it caught the attention of the New Gods, for they could hear his screams of anguish. It was Tomas that answered these cries, and brought Fazeal to his court. It was here that a pact was made with the New God - his service in exchange for his return to Athien.\n\nIt is now rumoured that Lord Fazeal wanders Mideon freely, recruiting fellow undead to his cause - a cause that does not end with simply winning his patron eternal favour. Once his services are paid in full to Tomas, he plans to return to Athien where he will take his rightful seat as ruler of all.\n\n- Saiyin, Elf Priestess",
