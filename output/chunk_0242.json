Feel free to ignore these suggestions but be aware that some imbalances may occur.\n\nGenerally we prefer maps that are balanced on both sides but this is not absolutely necessary. Ideally the decision to go first/ second or choose table sides should be a decision based on player preference, Warband construction, terrain, Shrine, and spawning pit locations. When working out the placement of elements, count hexes from certain points (such as Effigies, deployment zones, etc) to make sure both players have an equal distance to reach them.\n\nTry to avoid having too many elements grouped on one side of the map - ideally we want to encourage skirmishes across the entire board.",
