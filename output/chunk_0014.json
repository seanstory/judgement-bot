  "text": "Each god provides their Warband with 3 Divine Gifts. These gifts give your Heroes special advantages on the battlefield and help to bring you closer to victory. Refer to your god's card for more on their unique Divine Gifts.\n\nWarband Bonus: The Warband Bonus is always in play and affects all Heroes from that Warband throughout the game (including Heroes that are not Champions for that god).\n\nSacred Artefact: The Artefact is a bonus item that is added to the player's Magical Artefact deck. It behaves as any other Magical Artefact would, but can only be equipped by Champions of that Warband.\n\nEffigy Power: The Effigy Power is a one-off ability that the player must declare during the Communion Phase, just after fallen Heroes are resurrected. This power only affects Heroes that belong to the Champion's list for that god, and is unique to each particular god. Effigy Power must be declared in current turn order (the player going first this round).",
