  "text": "Not all dice are created equal. A roll in the world of Judgement requires a little more planning than a standard family-game-night roll. The number of dice that you can roll for your attack will be affected by the battlefield and your actions, just as your attack would be affected in a real battle. Start with your base calculation, and then add/subtract using your chosen attack's modifiers.\n\n' Listen to me, Child. The first rule of combat is to lead with your shield or your weapon - not your face! I' ve seen many 'would-be' heroes meet a swift end by charging head first into combat without thinking of the consequences. If you' ve got anything of value above your shoulders, you need to use it.'",
