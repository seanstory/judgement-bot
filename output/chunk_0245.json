  "text": "A combination of random and predetermined Monster Pits will provide an interesting and exciting experience for both players. Games should have between 2-4 Monster Pits per map.\n\nSave random tier 1-4 Monsters for the centre line. Tier 4 Monsters are very powerful and if generated randomly, closer to deployment zones, it can be too much of an advantage/ disadvantage to players. Ideally tier 4 are restricted to the centre line, but if you want to try to place them closer to the players' deployment zones, we suggest you give both sides the same Monster and proceed with caution.\n\nWhen Placing Monsters, try to Place them where they will be relevant. Monster placement is important as they can threaten Soul Pits, Shrines, and even Effigies. Occasionally it's also advisable to have them placed where players can try to execute a first round kill for levelling and Magical Artefact bonuses.",
