  "text": "Grul is the greatest Minotaur Shaman to have ever lived, and was one of the few mortals to have ever peered into the realm of the old gods. By communing with the spirits of nature, she had been shown the horror of Mideon. As a God, Grul has become a part of the very landscape of Mideon, and it is a part of her. Able to transform her shape at will, she often appears not as a humanoid but as a verdant forest glade, her voice a whisper on the wind. She only appears to those who pass the challenges that she offers and prefers champions who have a good heart, but she also embraces those who find themselves cast out and alone.",
