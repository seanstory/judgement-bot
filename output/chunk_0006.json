  "text": "Your Effigy is the greatest source of your power on this plane. It is what allows you to draw your Heroes onto the battlefield on the plane of Mideon. To maintain and grow that power, you must overwhelm the Effigy of your opponent while protecting your own. The first player to overwhelm their opponent's Effigy (reduce its base health to zero) wins the game immediately. The opponent's Effigy will be remade in the image of your god, taking you one step closer to ultimate victory!\n\nAn Effigy's base health is reduced by harvesting unbound Souls , harvesting Souls of slain enemy Heroes , and/ or direct damage from models using their Basic Attacks (listed on the Attribute Card of a Hero).",
