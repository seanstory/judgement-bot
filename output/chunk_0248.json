  "text": "This map is often a first turn 'cat 'n' mouse' as both players try to secure the Gloom kill. If you are unable to kill her in one activation, you don't want to leave her too low or your opponent might steal the kill! The battle for the Shrine is the other interesting element of this map as it also puts you in a good position to contest the Soul Pit. A Soulist is a great Hero to have around that Shrine.\n\nShrines: The Shrine awards D3 Fate to the Warband that controls it.\n\nMonsters: Gloom starts the game on the board and will respawn during the 2nd Communion Phase after she is killed.\n\nSouls: Randomise which pit the first Soul spawns from during the second round Communion Phase and then alternate spawning a Soul between the two Soul Pits after that.\n\nA Soul will not spawn if there are already 2 or more unbound Souls on the map.\n\nCoordinates : Impassable Terrain (2,3); Soul Pit (3,5); Wall (2,6) (3,7) (4,8); Gloom (5,6); Smoke (6,6) (6,7) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) (8,6) (8,7); Treacherous Ground (8,6) (8,7); Soul Pit (9,6), Shrine (11,5); Forest (10,3) (11,2) (11,3) (12,2); Forest (12,6) (12,7) (12,8) (13,5); Centre hexes for Effigies (7,2) (7,10).",
