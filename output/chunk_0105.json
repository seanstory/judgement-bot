If they are not on zero health skip to step 6.\n\n- y Their Soul is automatically harvested by the Hero that caused the final damage point (see ' Soul Harvesting ' pg.76).\n\n- y Any additional Souls that were Bound to the dead Hero are immediately removed from the game and the opposing Effigy gains back that health.\n\n- y Any Tokens that are on that Hero can now be removed from the game.\n\nNote: All Tokens and other effects that the dead Hero has in play still remain in play (for example, Sir Marcus' wall or Haksa's Idols).",
