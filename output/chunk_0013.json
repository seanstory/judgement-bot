  "text": "Torin is the only new god who is actually not new at all. Torin was old when the world was young, and was there to see the first of the old gods come into being. She represents the balance that all things must maintain in order for there to be harmony. She is the passage of time, and the strands of fate that bind the universe together. The old gods once worshiped her and called her mother, learning all that they could from her. Those times have long passed, and she is all that remains.",
