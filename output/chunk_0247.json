  "text": "Placement of terrain is just as important as the placement of Shrines, and Monster and Soul Pits. Have a good balance between forest/smoke and walls. Terrain can be used to make it more difficult to access the elements players will be fighting over. Remember that Shrines also provide cover, take this into consideration when creating your maps. Ideally between 4-6 pieces of terrain, plus Shrines will create a challenging battlefield.",
