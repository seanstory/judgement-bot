The knocked down model remains in the same hex it was attempting to leave and can still use other Action Points if it has them available. If a model suffers knock down as the result of a Parting Blow attack and is currently on a hex occupied by another model or terrain feature, the model must be placed within the last legal hex it occupied along the path it took the hex where the Parting Blow was made.",
