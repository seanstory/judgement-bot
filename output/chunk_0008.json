  "text": "Bruelin was once a Dwarf champion, celebrated by his people for his skill in battle. As a God, he maintains his warrior instincts and his inquisitive nature, but his impulse-control and focus is lacking. Bruelin now thinks of himself as being DragonKin - the stuff of Dwarf nightmares. His physical shape has grown to titanic proportions, and he walks the plane of Mideon looking for anything that might provide entertainment. He is insatiably curious but, due to his size, this often translates into him being incredibly destructive. Champions of Bruelin are often brash warriors, valuing their might over their minds.",
