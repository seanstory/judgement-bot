  "text": "Shrines and Soul Pits are where most battles take place. The reward for controlling a Shrine is usually Fate and can be set at any desired amount but there is a balance between too much Fate and not enough. Centre line Shrines generally provide D3 Fate. Shrines that are not on the centre line should provide 1 Fate if it is on your side of the board, or 2 if it is on the opponent's side. This is flexible, but as with Soul Pits, we do not want them to be too easily controlled. There must be a balanced risk for reward as an element of gameplay.",
