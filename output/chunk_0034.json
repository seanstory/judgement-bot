Note: you are not required to draft the Avatar of your god.\n\nAvatars immediately gain an extra ability once their Effigy Power has been called. The ability is kept for the rest of the game. All Avatar's have the common innate ability Honour .\n\nAs a consequence of this blessing from their god, when an Avatar is killed (only after its Effigy Power is called) and its Soul is harvested, the opposing player will also gain 1 Fate.",
