There is no limit to the number of rounds that are played in one game; rounds simply repeat until an Effigy has been captured and the game ends. Each round consists of 2 phases; the Communion Phase and the Activation Phase .\n\n' The fallen of Athien are the fodder for my horde. Mortals peddle their wares for coin but, to become a god, one must learn to exchange flesh for souls. All the mortals of Athien will belong to me, in time.'",
