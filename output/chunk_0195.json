  "text": "Battlefield maps have 1 or more Monster Pits in clearly marked hexes. Monsters have their own cards which describe how they function . Monsters count as enemy models to all Heroes, Summoned, and Effigy models.\n\nMonsters are ranked from Tier 1-3, represented with 'T(X)' on their cards. Each map details which Monster can be used on each spawning pit. When there is a need to spawn a random Monster refer to the map to determine which Monster tiers are possible from that spawning pit. Pool all the Monsters from those tiers and randomise between those Monsters equally.",
