  "text": "If a model begins an Advance / Charge on a hex containing rough ground or passes through it during an Advance / Charge , the model suffers a -1 MOV penalty for that action. However, models can move into rough ground with their last hex of movement with no MOV penalty. Examples of rough ground are Forests and other terrain features that are labelled as such on the battlefield maps.",
