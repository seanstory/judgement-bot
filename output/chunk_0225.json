  "text": "Character Shrines have special abilities and rules that can aid your Heroes in battle. Those rules can be found on your battlefield map. Examples of character Shrines are the 'Shrine to Wellin' (heals models and aids in attacks) and the 'Shrine to Arden' (aids in Placement and attacks). If a character Shrine makes an attack and kills an enemy model, the Hero that claimed that Shrine gains all the benefits from the kill.\n\nIn this diagram, Saiyin is controlling the Shrine.\n\nIn this diagram, the Shrine is being contested. To regain control, Saiyin and her teammates will have to defeat Gloom, and Push Rakkir off the adjacent hex or kill him.",
