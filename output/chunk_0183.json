Models can move through a hex occupied by a friendly Small model (and vice versa), during an Advance or Charge , providing they have enough movement to move past them. Small models require an additional symbol to move nonSmall models with a Push Combat Manoeuvre .\n\nSmall models treat walls and other terrain of height 1 as impassable and cannot advance over them.",
