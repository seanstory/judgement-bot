  "text": "Active Player: The player who controls the Hero currently being activated.\n\nAdjacent: Any hex that shares a border with another hex. A hex is also adjacent to itself.\n\nAP: Action Point(s)\n\nAway/Towards: There are 3 instances of moving away/towards another model or hex, Advance , Place or Push .\n\n1. Advance : When a model is required to Advance it must take the shortest route. This means that it requires the least movement through unoccupied hexes. If multiple options exist the active player can decide which route to take. Models can move around occupied hexes if required, but at all times the end goal must be the shortest route.\n\n2. Place: When a model is required to be Placed it must take a Direct Line. If the target hex of a Placed model is occupied, then the model will be Placed in the first unoccupied hex on the trajectory of its movement. However, its movement must be equal to or less than the stated 'move' distance, or it will not be moved at all.\n\n3. Push: When a model is required to be Pushed it must take the shortest route and must be in a Direct Line. If multiple options exist the active player can decide which route to take. The Pushed model must stop if its path is blocked by a hex that is occupied.\n\nFor all instances, the model being moved must stop once any further movement will not bring it further away or closer from/to the original goal, with the following exception:\n\nIf a model is attempting to Advance around or through an occupied hex then it may still be moved (if the controlling player wishes) provided that it does not end it's Advance further away from its end goal.\n\nBasic Attack : The weapons listed on the Card 1 (Attribute card) of a model.\n\nChampion: A Hero that is aligned to a particular god and gains benefits when taken in a Warband that uses the Effigy of that god. Indicated by the god symbols on Hero cards.\n\nCrossing Through a Hex: Crossing through a hex would involve drawing a line that enters and leaves a hex. Drawing a parallel line down the edge of a hex would also count as crossing.\n\nA line that touches only a single point on a hex (does not enter and leave) would not count as crossing.\n\nD2: Roll a D6. A roll of 1-3 counts as a 1, a roll of 4-6 counts as a 2.\n\n- D3: Roll a D6, divide by 2 and round up.\n\nD6: D6 refers to the standard 6-sided die. When an ability or effect calls for a roll of (X)+, roll a D6. If the roll equals to or is greater than (X) it succeeds.\n\nDamage: A model is considered to have taken damage when the model has its health reduced by 1 or more. Once a model takes damage it is considered to have taken damage for the duration of that attack action, regardless of whether the damage is healed back.\n\n- y True Damage: Damage that ignores a model's RES.\n\nDeployment Zone: The designated hexes where Heroes are allowed to be Placed at start-of-game. Heroes with Bound Souls will lose those souls if they end their activation in their Warband's deployment zone.\n\nDisengage: One model moves away from another model, breaking engagement. This is usually followed by a Parting Blow.\n\nDuplicate Artefacts: If a second copy of a non-Monster Bounty Artefact is gained from the opponent's deck (e.g. Bale's Siphon Magic), the duplicate item is treated independently for this rule.\n\nEngaged: A model is considered engaged when it is within the melee reach, and line-of-sight, of an enemy model.\n\nEngaging: A model is considered to be engaging an enemy model when they have that enemy model within their melee reach and line-of-sight.\n\nEnter: To Advance , be Pushed , Placed  or Thrown to within a specified area, from outside of that area.\n\nFriendly: All models a player controls are friendly to each other. A model is friendly to itself.  Models cannot be simultaneously friendly to opposing Warbands.\n\nHeal: Remove damage which is marked on a health card.",
