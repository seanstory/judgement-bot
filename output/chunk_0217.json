  "text": "Regeneration: At the start of each Communion Phase, Effigies regenerate all damage inflicted upon them in the previous round by enemy Basic Attacks . The base health reduction from enemy Bound and Banked Souls remains.\n\nWhen Effigies regenerate their health at the start of the Communion phase, this counts as the Effigy activating. As a result, Tokens that expire at the start of a model's activation are removed from the Effigy.\n\nHealing: Heroes can use certain Abilities to heal their Effigy during a game since it is a friendly model to their Warband. However, only direct damage made by enemy Basic Attacks can be healed this way.",
