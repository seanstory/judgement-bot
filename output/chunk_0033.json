  "text": "To capture your opponent's Effigy, you will need a balanced Warband of the most battle-savvy Heroes to fight on your behalf.\n\nSelecting a Warband is largely influenced by the god you choose to represent on the table-top. The Heroes that you choose should be your Champions (i.e. aligned with your cause). If you're feeling more welcoming, it doesn't hurt to employ one or more Heroes that don't follow you. The only downside is that not all of your Effigy's benefits will apply to those Heroes.",
