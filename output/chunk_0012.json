  "text": "Tomas is renowned as a ruthless and precise general. He is fair, but stern, and expects the warriors in his armies to be disciplined and competent. His immortal form is that of a middle-aged man - taciturn and unchanging. He prefers to spend his time within his fortress, often sitting upon his throne, strategizing the conquering of all of Mideon. Those who serve him value discipline and are willing to do what it takes to maintain order.",
