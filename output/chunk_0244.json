  "text": "Avoid placing Soul Pits within 2 hexes of cover, forests or smoke. Having a Soulist being able to stay invisible or even in cover can sometimes be very difficult to overcome and might make the game frustrating for players. Avoid placing Soul Pits too close to players' Effigies as it should be a risk to harvest Souls. A good mix of 1, 2, or 3 Soul Pits per map is desirable.",
