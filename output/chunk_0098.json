If part of your dice pool has been re-rolled and an ability requires that you re-roll your dice pool, then you re-roll any of the dice in your pool that have not yet been re-rolled.\n\nWhen two or more rules allow/force you to re-roll dice, apply the following to determine the order of rolls:\n\n1. The active player is given 1st option to use an ability to reroll any dice they are able to. This could include multiple re-rolls, such as using Augury (Saiyin's ability) to re-roll 1 die and then Try Again for the remaining dice.\n\n2. The non-active player is then given the option to use an ability to force the active player to re-roll any dice that have not already been re-rolled. Even if the non-active player has the ability to force the active player to re-roll their entire dice pool (such as through the Gift of the Gods Artefact).",
