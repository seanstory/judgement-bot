Avoid placing terrain directly in front and blocking access to them. This can hamper opponents but also the owning player's manoeuvrability may be adversely affected. Avoid placing Effigies too far into the middle of the map, as bringing a Hero up to attack an opposing Effigy should be difficult to achieve.",
