  "text": "This is the simplest method, and best for newer players. This method is called 'Blind Pick', because the players select their Warbands independently of each other.\n\nBoth players select Heroes they want to use, relative to the selected game mode (3 or 5 Heroes). The players reveal their Warbands and then roll a D6 initiative roll. The highest roll chooses one of the following, while the lowest roll takes the remaining option:\n\n- (A) Decide to take 1st or 2nd turn of the game.\n\n- (B) Choose table sides.",
