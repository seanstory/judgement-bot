  "text": "Champions are Heroes that are aligned to a god and their values. Heroes that are Champions have access to the Sacred Artefacts and Effigy Powers provided by their god's Effigy. If Heroes are included in Warbands where they are not one of the Champions for that god, they do not benefit from that god's Effigy Powers and cannot equip the god's Sacred Artefact. However, they do benefit from the Warband Bonus.\n\n'These creatures are nothing of the like I've ever seen in Midëon, or anywhere else. When they fell upon us, we were horrified. Though I am unsure of the origin of these Monsters, I did know that when I slammed my blade through the ribcage of one, it was very aware of its mortality. How it hated me, as I tugged my gore-stricken blade from its chest, and I could sense that it was cursing me in some fell language of its own. Regardless of the god it served, I knew in the depths of my heart that it would not be the last one I would slay. There is a part of me that feels this may be the beginning of something that even the gods may fear.'\n\n- Isabel, Avatar of Ista",
